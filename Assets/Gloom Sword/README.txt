Notes:
 - Textures with endings "_a", "_g", "_b", "_r" and the like are split textures as the primary texture in question stores data in separate channels. When extensions are combined (e.g. "_a_g_b") this means that those channels were identical for that image, i.e. in that case the alpha, green, and blue channel store the same data in that image.
